# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

-Being able to interpret and implement user needs into a program come with clear communication and establishing "user stories". Creating users stories allows for clearly defined goals and requirement that both a user and a developer can understand.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

-My approach to developing programs is to take in the user requirements and priorize them and when developing I try to over deliver on quality of work. The agile process I hope to incorporate in my future development work is while working on a team being able to communicate quickly and effectively to resolve problems that may arise.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

- In software development being a good team member is being able to complete the work assigned to you or be able to communicate appropriatly when you are stuck or run into issues.
